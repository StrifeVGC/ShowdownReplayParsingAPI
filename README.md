# ShowdownReplayParsingAPI

Repository for ShowdownReplayParsingAPI, a project aiming to parse pokemon showdown replays from Json, which will then provide information such as teams used in the match, who won, archetypes used, format, moves used in the match, and other statistics.

This is a work in progress and the readme file will be updated as the project grows.

Written in C#( .Net 6.0).
